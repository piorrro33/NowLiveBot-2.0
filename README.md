> A Discord bot that announces streamers as they go live!

## Supported Platforms
* Twitch
* Beam (Currently disabled due to performance concerns)

## Planned Platforms
* YouTube
* HitBox

## The Basics

> You MUST be a manager to execute these commands!

### Permissions (The How & Why)

> Now Live requires the following permissions in order to do what you expect out of it.

#### Administrator
Allows the bot to do everything it needs to do (send, delete, edit announcements) and leave it open for future implementations of different features.
Please don't change the permissions to anything else as the bot will likely not do everything it needs to do.

### Invite the bot to your server
To add Now Live to your server, [click here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=240729664035880961&scope=bot&permissions=8).

> **IMPORTANT:**  Leave the bot permissions as they are!  The bot needs all of those permissions to do its job!  Removing any of those permissions could cause the bot to not work properly in your server!

### Add Additional Managers (optional)
> **NOTE:**  All peeps in your server with Administrator and Manage Server permissions are automagically added as managers!

To add additional managers use the following command:

`-nl add manager @<user>`


Additionally, you can remove managers by typing:

`-nl remove manmager @<user>`

### Add Channels to Monitor
> **NOTE:** Twitch is currently the only supported platform.  I will update this when more platforms are added.

To add channels, type:

`-nl twitch add channel <channel-name>`


Example:  `-nl twitch add channel AgueMort`

> **IMPORTANT:** Only add the channel name.  Adding the full URL of the channel will not work.

If you messed up, you can remove the channel using:

`-nl twitch remove channel <channel-name>`

#### Filters
Filters allow you to only have channels announced when the streamer is playing a specific game.  Filters are global and will apply to all platforms that are implemented in the future!

To add a filter, type:

`-nl add filter <game-name>`


To remove filters, type:

`-nl remove filter <game-name>`

### Add Games, Tags and Teams
> **NOTE:**  Currently Tags and Teams are still being worked on for Twitch.  I expect to have them ready soon.

To add a game ***(this will announce EVERY LIVE STREAM for that game!)***, type:

`-nl add game <game-name>`

Example:

`-nl add game World of Warcraft`


To remove a game, type:

`-nl remove game <game-name>`

Example:

`-nl remove game World of Warcraft`

### Change Which Discord Channel the Streams Are Announced In (optional)
> **NOTE:**  You MUST include the hash-tag (#) in front of the channel name!  This command will not work otherwise!

`-nl move #<channel-name>`
